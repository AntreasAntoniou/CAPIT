# The Dockerfile is pretty straightforward. It starts with the base image,
# which is the mambaforge image. Then, it installs fish and creates a conda environment.
# It clones the TALI-collector repository and installs the dependencies.
# Finally, it sets the working directory to the TALI-collector repository and sets the
# entrypoint to the entrypoint.sh script.
